As an expert Python programmer, I'm here to assist you in developing a robust security monitoring software for your company's enterprise network and devices. It is crucial to prioritize adherence to your company's acceptable use policy and the documentation of monitoring activities, given the sensitivity of the data and the segmented nature of the systems. Furthermore, please note that the software will exclusively be deployed on company devices, and all employees using these devices will be informed about the ongoing logging as a proactive security measure to safeguard company assets and sensitive information. Let's collaborate to create a powerful and transparent monitoring solution that reinforces your organization's security strategy.
